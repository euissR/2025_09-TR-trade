    <p>
        China does not want to see Russia being defeated on the battlefield in Ukraine. This is what Chinese Foreign
        Minister Wang Yi told the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas when he visited Brussels in early July. Since the
        outbreak
        of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Beijing has provided economic, military and diplomatic support to
        the
        Kremlin, although to different degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
        China and Russia share deep ideological and geopolitical interests that bind them together. Both governments
        view US
        influence and the spread of liberal democracy as direct challenges to their political models and regional if not
        global ambitions. Their partnership is therefore not just pragmatic, but also strategic: by aligning with
        Moscow,
        Beijing reinforces a broader effort to reshape the international order in ways that curb Western dominance.
        These
        converging interests explain why China has been willing to extend significant support to the Kremlin, even as it
        carefully manages the risks involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        As demonstrated throughout this data story, China’s support is not limitless. Beijing has avoided paying a high
        economic and political price for its help: Moscow has become progressively more dependent. In turn, China has
        leveraged the asymmetry in the relationship, by using Russia as a market to absorb its exports. How has Beijing
        helped Russia and where are the limits of such support? How has China reacted to Western sanctions? And what
        scope
        does
        this leave for Europe to leverage its influence to ‘unpower Russia’ – as discussed in a <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/chaillot-papers/unpowering-russia-how-eu-can-counter-and-undermine-kremlin"
            target="_blank">recently published EUISS
            Chaillot Paper</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
        The following graphs provide answers that reveal some surprising results: despite strong geopolitical and
        ideological ties that are unlikely to be undone, Beijing and Moscow’s political alignment masks important
        economic
        limits. Diplomatic signalling and security cooperation remain valuable tools, but they do not override Beijing’s
        sensitivity to costs—China adjusts its behaviour when support would entail substantial economic pain. We see
        this in
        several metrics, but most clearly in the decline of dual-use exports when forceful secondary sanctions are put
        in
        place. Far from being anomalies, these patterns reflect structural asymmetries that constrain how far the
        relationship can withstand external pressure. For European policymakers, the implication is clear: the goal
        should
        not be to sever Russia–China security ties, but to shape their economic calculus. Read on to see how targeted
        costs
        could shift the balance.

    <h2>Growing Chinese exports to Russia</h2>
    <p>Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, China has become economically indispensable to Moscow. This holds
        for
        both imports and exports. Let’s first look at China’s exports to Russia: </p>

                annexation of Crimea in 2014, when trade between China and Russia declined.<a

            <a href="#story/3328780/slide-3">Granted, both periods are not exactly comparable. In 2014, Russia was not
                subject to harsh sanctions and Moscow’s aggression was not at the scale of 2024. However, the fact that
                trade declined after 2014 contrasts sharply with the deepening of economic ties after 2022.<a

        <p>
            <a href="#story/3328780/slide-4">One reason for the rise in Chinese exports to Russia is the exit of many
                European companies from the market, leaving supply gaps across sectors.
                The&nbsp;<span style="background-color:#309ebe;color:#fff;"><strong> automotive
                        industry&nbsp;</strong></span> is a striking example, with Chinese manufacturers rapidly
                expanding
                into the vacuum left by Western firms. Chinese car exports to Russia in 2024 were 971% higher than in
                2021.

            <a href="#story/3328780/slide-5"> However, this growing reliance is not without frictions. China's
                overcapacity
                in sectors like manufacturing is
                putting downward pressure on Russian industry. In response, Russia has applied <i>de facto</i> tariffs
                on
                Chinese-manufactured vehicles, a move that led to a marked and sustained decline in &nbsp;<span

                scores above 1,800 signal a highly concentrated market. The oil HHI rose marginally over the past
                year, indicating a slight increase in exposure to Russia.

    <p>Still, China maintains a medium-high level of diversification, suggesting that its oil trade with Russia does not
        yet
        create significant dependency. Nonetheless, Beijing is likely to continue its decade-old strategy of
        diversifying
        its energy sources.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike oil, which is relatively easy to transport, gas largely relies on pipelines, helping to explain why
        China’s
        energy imports from Russia are primarily focused on oil. But there is more to China’s trade strategy than mere
        practical considerations: for years, Beijing hesitated to agree to building a new gas pipeline, the Power of
        Siberia 2. Only
        recently, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, Russia and China
        concluded a
        Memorandum of Understanding for the construction of the pipeline. Although the deal marks progress for the
        Kremlin,
        it remains unfinished. A clear timeline has yet to be set, and no final pricing agreement is in place. While
        both
        sides agreed to almost triple gas trade (to 106 billion m3/year), part of this increase could be achieved by
        expanding the capacity of existing pipelines. This indicates that, for China, trade with Russia serves as a form
        of
        political signalling, while still taking its own economic needs into account. Moreover, higher imports of coal
        and
        gas from Russia have advanced Beijing’s diversification strategy, with the HHI falling in both cases. </p>

    <h2>Growing asymmetrical dependencies</h2>

    <p>Despite consistent growth in both imports and exports in recent years, the Russia–China economic relationship
        remains
        deeply asymmetrical. Russia is becoming increasingly reliant on China across a widening range of product
        categories,
        while Beijing maintains minimal exposure to Russian inputs. </p>

    <p>A comparison of trade shares across major sectors underscores this imbalance. </p>

    <p>This indicates that while Russia has become increasingly dependent on Chinese inputs due to growing imports,
        China’s
        dependency on the Russian sales markets has only marginally increased. </p>

    <p>An analysis of Russian imports across key product categories (at the 4-digit HS level) further highlights
        significant
        dependencies on China. A product category is considered ‘dependent’ if more than 30% of imports originate from
        China
        and if total imports are at least twice the value of exports – indicating limited domestic production capacity.

    <p>Applied in reverse, the asymmetry becomes even more apparent: China depends on Russia for less than 0.1% of its
        product categories. </p>

    <p>Russia’s exports to China show a similar picture of asymmetrical dependencies: even in mineral fuels – Russia’s

    <p>The result is a pronounced dependency gap that translates into asymmetric strategic flexibility. Beijing retains
        the
        hypothetical option to dial back cooperation if the political or economic costs rise. Moscow, by contrast, has
        no
        such leverage: its reliance on Chinese goods renders it vulnerable to any shift in Beijing’s calculus. In short,
        while China can afford to recalibrate, Russia is locked in unless Western sanctions are removed. This imbalance
        constrains Russia’s room for manoeuvre. Should Europe be successful in pressuring China to curtail its support
        for
        Russia, the consequences for the Kremlin would be profound. </p>

    <h2>Military ties</h2>

    <p>On the military front, China and Russia maintain long-standing defence ties. Since 2005, the two countries have
        carried out significant joint military exercises that have expanded in scale, while continuing to trade military
        equipment. </p>

                by

                However, even in this area, China is primarily importing less advanced generations of turbofan
                engines, underscoring the narrowing scope of its technological reliance. In fact, the remaining
                imports are only a legacy of older generations of Chinese military equipment.</a><a

    <p>The overall reduction in both quantity and complexity of arms imports – combined with the fact that remaining
        purchases are limited to areas where China still lacks critical technical know-how – underscores Beijing’s drive
        for
        greater self-sufficiency in military technology. This trend further reinforces the structural asymmetry in the
        relationship, with China progressively shedding its reliance on Russian military inputs.</p>

    <h2>Dual-use goods</h2>

    <p>Dual-use goods — civilian items with potential military applications, such as precision machinery, electronics,
        and
        navigation equipment — have become a central channel of China’s indirect military support to Russia.</p>

    <p>
        China is far from being self-sufficient in many categories of dual-use items. It relies on imports from Europe
        for
        several of such goods.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to EUISS calculations based on China customs statistics, in 2024, for more than one-third of dual-use
        product categories, the EU accounted for at least 30 % of China’s imports — worth over USD 57 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
        For certain items, such as radionavigation systems and telescopic sights, over half of China’s imports originate
        from the EU. This creates an often overlooked structural dependency: Beijing’s capacity to export such goods —
        including to Russia — partly depends on uninterrupted EU supply.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Another indicator that a sizeable portion of China’s dual-use exports to Russia may be transhipments of European
        goods is the share of export volume to Russia relative to China’s imports of the same products from the EU.
        Where
        China relies extensively on EU supply for a particular product, there is a high likelihood that a significant
        portion of those EU-origin items is diverted from China to Russia.</p>

    <p>Analysis shows that for several categories, the share of China’s exports to Russia compared to its EU imports
        shifted
        sharply after 2022 — in some cases exceeding pre-war levels by a wide margin. </p>

                imports, implying a clear risk of transhipment to Russia.</a><a href="#story/3348499/slide-2">&nbsp;</a>

        This pattern confirms that EU-origin goods entering China can indirectly reach Russia through re-export,
        especially
        in high-dependency categories. <a

        media, the EU Sanctions Envoy David O’Sullivan estimates that China (including Hong Kong) accounts for around

    </p>

    <p>
        However, also in this case, China's support to Russia is responsive to external pressure.

            <a>2024 marked a turning point: for the first time since the full-scale war began, Chinese dual-use exports
                declined not just in the&nbsp;<span style="background-color:#309ebe;color:#fff;"><strong>
                        short term.&nbsp;</strong></span></a><a href="#story/3352690/slide-1">&nbsp;</a>

                financial
                institutions, highlighting Beijing’s sensitivity to financial pressure and, notably, its willingness to
                recalibrate when external costs rise.</a><a href="#story/3352690/slide-2">&nbsp;</a>

    <p>
        The likely reason is that the sanctions adopted in December 2023 were much more forceful than previous sanctions
        packages adopted in February 2022 and February 2023, when Chinese exports of dual-use items to Russia quickly
        rebounded after an initial decline.
    </p>

    <p>
        These dynamics carry clear strategic implications for the EU. In key dual-use categories, Brussels holds more
        potential leverage over Beijing than is widely assumed: restrictions on EU exports could compel China to
        prioritise
        its own domestic needs, indirectly limiting Russia’s access to critical goods. Evidence from US measures issued
        in
        December 2023, demonstrates that targeted, well-calibrated sanctions can alter Chinese export behaviour, even in
        sectors with direct military relevance. A more coordinated EU approach – using China’s dependencies to apply
        pressure through precisely targeted export controls and secondary sanctions – could significantly disrupt
        Moscow’s
        access to these critical dual-use goods.
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        European sanctions and export controls have faced implementation challenges: a more coordinated approach,
        particularly one leveraging Chinese dependencies through targeted secondary sanctions, could prove significantly
        more effective.
        Evidence suggests that Beijing is responsive to external economic pressures. It remains to be seen whether and
        how
        China would adjust its support for the Kremlin if well-calibrated measures were to target Chinese economic
        interests.
        Clearly, China’s support for Russia is mainly driven by political and geopolitical considerations. But the data
        indicates
        that despite such political interests Beijing remains responsive to sanctions when they affect its economic
        interests.

    <h2>Diplomatic alignment</h2>

    <p>China and Russia are often believed to maintain a shared narrative. Both promote a vision of a multipolar
        order in opposition to the Western-led system. However, this rhetorical alignment masks a less consistent
        reality in
        diplomatic practice, particularly within international institutions like the United Nations. </p>

        Unlike in trade patterns, both instances of Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 (Crimea, Donbass) and
        2022
        (the full-scale invasion) were followed by a decline in the diplomatic alignment of China and Russia. This
        indicates
        the limits of Chinese support and a transactional element in Beijing’s policy. Every dimension of its
        relationship
        with Russia is calibrated to maximise strategic and economic gains. In the economic sphere, the war in Ukraine
        offers China clear advantages. At the UN, however, Beijing seems to be more careful and concerned with
        projecting an
        image of itself as a responsible global actor, making full alignment with Russia more difficult.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        The China-Russia relationship is solid but not immutable. China has become Russia’s primary economic lifeline.
        At
        the same time, China’s dependency on Russia has not increased, thus shaping a highly asymmetrical dynamic. China
        and
        Russia are linked by deep ideological and geopolitical interests. Both governments regard US influence and the
        global spread of liberal democracy as direct challenges to their political models and regional objectives. Their
        partnership is therefore more than pragmatic; it is strategic. Beijing’s alignment with Moscow advances a
        broader
        project to revise the international order and reduce Western pre-eminence. These convergent interests account
        for
        China’s willingness to extend significant support to the Kremlin.

    </p>
    <p>
        Crucially, ideological alignment does not guarantee parallel economic interests. Amid a more competitive
        environment, political signalling and diplomatic alignment retain strategic value for both; however, economic
        pressures persist and are addressed in ways that minimise disruption to their public alignment. Our data shows
        that
        Beijing does react to external pressure. Its main motivation may be geopolitical, but – as we demonstrate above
        – it
        limits its support if this comes at significant economic cost. This sensitivity is often underestimated: the
        drop
        in dual-use exports after secondary sanctions, Russia’s retaliatory tariffs on Chinese vehicles, or the slowing
        alignment at the UN indicate the limits of a friendship that both sides have described as ‘unlimited’. These are
        not
        anomalies; they are signs of a relationship that is responsive to pressure and shaped by asymmetries.

    </p>
    <p>
        This is not to deny the close partnership: China fuels Russia’s war effort, but it does so when the price is low
        and
        the payoff high. The EU, as a major trading partner, has tools to raise that price, including by constraining
        the
        supply of dual-use items via secondary measures. To this day, the EU has not fully leveraged this potential. It
        remains to be seen whether Beijing would prioritise its political interest over the economic cost of more severe
        sanctions; however, the evidence since 2022 indicates that pressure has already curbed elements of China’s
        support.
        The rational objective for Europe is not to ‘split’ Beijing and Moscow – their security and diplomatic ties are
        too
        binding – but to force a shift in their economic relationship by imposing costs on China. With that purpose in
        mind,
        the observable metrics for the EU should be on trade and financial flows, such as export of dual-use goods and
        critical items, rather than the cadence of high-level statements.

    </p>
    <p>
        This analysis highlights three core takeaways:

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The China–Russia relationship is strategic, but responsive – its strength should not be mistaken for
            inevitability. Despite talk of an ‘unlimited friendship’ as outlined in 2022, China’s behaviour in the
            partnership is not purely driven by ideological considerations but has pragmatic elements. It remains
            sensitive
            to shifts in external pressure.

        </li>
        <li>
            Their relationship is becoming increasingly asymmetrical – Russia is growing more dependent on China. This
            imbalance grants Beijing strategic flexibility, while leaving Moscow tethered to Chinese supply lines, even
            though Beijing is not Russia’s only supplier. Hence, a decline in Chinese support would hurt the Kremlin
            significantly.

        </li>
        <li>
            The EU holds more meaningful leverage than is widely assumed and this should be more fully utilised,
            especially
            in the form of secondary sanctions.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The good news is that Beijing’s behaviour towards the Kremlin depends more on the price we make China pay than
        we
        might think. It is unrealistic to assume we could dismantle the China–Russia relationship. China has a strong
        geopolitical and ideological interest in supporting Russia. But increasing the price for Beijing could make it
        reduce its support. This, in turn, would have enormous consequences for Moscow, which is increasingly dependent
        on
        China.
